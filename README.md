# Standards Starter

Standards Starter is intended to function as a boilerplate repository to help your company/organization quickly implement standards used by your entire team.

The standards and document structure presented here were adapted from the [Human Made Engineering Handbook](https://engineering.hmn.md/standards/).

## Contributing

Have a good idea? Find one of my (I assume many) typos? Great! [Create an issue](https://github.com/mattsparks/standards-starter/issues) or fork this repo and send a pull request.

## How to Use

It's important to note that while the default standards are mostly concerned with PHP, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS, the goal of this project is to be flexible enough to fit any project type or technology stack.

To that end, you'll notice that certain sections (Ex: [File Structure](structure/README.md)) only contain placeholder documents. These documents should be written to fit your company or organization's own practices.

### Getting Started

Fork this repository and modify it to fit your own needs.

## Introduction

To ensure everyone’s able to work effectively and efficiently, we enforce a number of standards across our code. Some of these are for performance and security in high-traffic, high-impact sites, while some enable us to collaborate more effectively.

While projects can deviate from these standards (and we encourage experimenting with new standards), projects tend to follow the majority of these rules and guidelines.
