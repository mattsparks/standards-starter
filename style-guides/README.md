# Style Guides

We have our own set of style guides for projects we work on. While we follow the WordPress style guidelines for the most part, there’s a lot of things those don’t cover.

[Markup Guidelines](MARKUP.md)

Guidelines specifically for the output in the DOM.

[CSS Guidelines](CSS.md)

Guidelines specifically for writing CSS.

[JavaScript Guidelines](JS.md)

Extra guidelines for writing modern (ES6+) JS.

[React Guidelines](REACT.md)

Guidelines specifically for writing React apps.

[PHP Guidelines](PHP.md)

Extra guidelines for writing modern (namespaced) PHP.

Note that these are simply guidelines, and you’re free to deviate from them if you want to. We’re always improving these, so if you come up with something better, propose a change!
